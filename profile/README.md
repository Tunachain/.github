# Welcome to Tuna Chain

Tuna Chain emerges as a groundbreaking Layer 2 (L2) solution on the Bitcoin (BTC) network, poised to redefine the boundaries of blockchain capabilities. 

Tuna Chain is conceptualised to synergise Bitcoin's unparalleled security with Ethereum's multifaceted EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) functionality. 
While Bitcoin stands as the most trusted cryptocurrency, its capability for complex smart contracts and advanced applications remains limited. 
Tuna Chain ambitiously endeavors to bridge this gap, integrating EVM compatibility into Bitcoin’s L2 framework and thus expanding the realm of possibilities for Bitcoin’s application and utility.
